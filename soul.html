In the world of Voidshard, the **soul** is the most basic, most essential part of every sentient being - that is, a living creature bearing a conscious mind.
 
Soul connects the three fundamental elements of the world:
 
* it binds a **[body]**,
 
* empowers a **[mind]**,
 
* and ultimately, channels sources of elemental **[magic]**.
 
Souls born spontanelously during the use of magic sources (that is, spellcasting), but wander unconsciously until they reach a [star], at which point they reside there before inhabiting the body of a newborn individual.

## Manifestation

### Extraordinary manifestations
 
Due to their nature, souls exist in various forms outside of stars and ordinary bodies:

* As a [ghost], souls **do** have a body, but it's only very loosely bonded to the physical world, and as such, they acquire abilities normal beings can't do, such as moving through obstacles, or staying in air indefinitely.
 
* As a [totem], a soul can be bonded to an inanimate object that it's incapable of using for motion. It can interact with its environment, through spellcasting, however, or enforce its [soul strength] and become a [golem]. It should be noted that soul strength can make inanimate objects bend and even break - the soul keeps bonded to its largest part, but the smaller the object, the looser the bond is.
 
## Localization

Regardless of their bonds, souls do have a spatial location, which can become visible or othervise perceivable during extreme emotional reactions.
