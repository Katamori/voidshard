### Blessed

A **[Blessed]** creature possesses the power of 10 mortal souls. They appear normal for their species, but have an outstanding performance in every field of life. More often than not, they populate the high end of their societal hierarchy.

### Champion

A **[Champion]** has the power of 100 mortal (or 10 Blessed) souls. They have slight differences in appearance from mortals, and their potential tend to manifest in physical properties. Because of it, they often fulfill military roles, but are not always accepted to the societal leadership.

Because of the emerging changes in physical properties, for many species (e.g. [human] and most of its descendants), this is the highest achievable semblance.
